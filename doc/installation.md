# Installation

## Requirements
Before installing **LCOV Reports for PHP**, you need to make sure you have [PHP](https://www.php.net)
and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org), the PHP package manager, up and running.

You can verify if you're already good to go with the following commands:

```shell
php --version
# PHP 7.4.5 (cli) (built: Apr 14 2020 16:17:19) ( NTS Visual C++ 2017 x64 )

composer --version
# Composer version 1.10.5 2020-04-10 11:44:22
```

!!! info
    If you plan to play with the package sources, you will also need the latest versions of
    [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell) and [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material).

## Installing with Composer package manager

### 1. Install it
From a command prompt, run:

```shell
composer require cedx/lcov
```

### 2. Import it
Now in your [PHP](https://www.php.net) code, you can use:

```php
<?php
use Lcov\{
  BranchCoverage, BranchData,
  FunctionCoverage, FunctionData,
  LineCoverage, LineData,
  LcovException, Record, Report, Token
};
```
